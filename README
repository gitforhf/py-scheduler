py-scheduler is a cron-like scheduler written in Python with some advanced
features.


Format of schedule table (tab):

sec    min    hour    weekday    day    month    function    args    kwargs
*      *      *       *          *      *        myfunc      5.6     y=[],z=3

The above example would execute this every second:
myfunc(3.5, y=[], z=3)

Format for time fields is very similar to crontab. It supports list of patterns
(<pattern1>,<pattern2>; e.g. *5,*0), ranges (<start>-<end>; e.g. 5-49) and
increments (<pattern>/<increment> or just /<increment> for whole range; e.g.
5-49/11,*7/5,/3).
Weekdays and days can be set for same job (unlike cron).


See CamScheduler (https://github.com/Kantist/CamScheduler) for an example of a
program using py-scheduler.


I've tested py-scheduler with Python 2.7.2 and Python 3.2.2; these are the
latest stable versions of Python. py-scheduler is thus Python 2/3 compatible.
