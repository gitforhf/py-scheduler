py-scheduler is a cron-like scheduler written in Python. It is not only for
users but also for developers.
See CamScheduler (https://github.com/Kantist/CamScheduler) for an example.

I've tested py-scheduler with Python 2.7.2 and Python 3.2.2; these are the
latest stable versions of Python. py-scheduler is thus Python 2/3 compatible.
